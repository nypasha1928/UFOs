### Overview
The purpose of this project was to take an insight on UFO Sightings using Java, HTML,and CSS. I created multiple filters for users to input and gather their own insight on UFO Sightings.

### Results
In order to gather insight on this data, we will pick a state to look into to give users an understanding of how this webpage functions. The state I will use is California. To start to go to the filer "Enter a State" and enter the abbreviation "ca" into the search bar then press the "Filter Table" Button.

The following image is what will be displayed:

Now, Lets go a step further and looking into a certain city within California. For this example we will use el cajo.

This follows the same process as the California filter, only that we add another layer to our filter which is adding a city! In the "Enter a City" filter we will enter "el cajo" as well as in the state filter add california just as we have done before.

### Summary
Overall the process of the webpage is easy to follow and intuitive. But a certain drawback with this webpage is that it is case sensitive in that if we type "el cajo" instead of "El Cajo" we will not get any results.

In further development of this webpage, I would recomend to correct this case sensitive issue as well as include more data into the webpage with UFO sightings!
